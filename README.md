## üöÄ About
**sdcard.photos** is a photo blog for a group of friends passionate about photography. Each person has their own subdomain allowing them to showcase their photographs. The actual photo blog uses [sambecker/exif-photo-blog](https://github.com/sambecker/exif-photo-blog) but this project aims to create a homepage that showcases photos uploaded by the group all in one page.
