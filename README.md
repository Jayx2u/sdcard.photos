## üöÄ About

**sdcard.photos** is a landing page for a group of photography enthusiasts who each have their own photo blog. The goal
of
this project is to create a smooth, minimalist webpage that showcases photos uploaded by the entire group, serving as a
central hub for their individual photo blogs.

- The landing page is built using _Next.js_, _TypeScript_, and _TailwindCSS_, smooth animations powered by _Anime.js_.
- The photos and EXIF information displayed on the landing page are fetched from a Postgres database
  which are synced with the groups' individual photo blogs. Database is hosted on Vercel Postgres and Object Storage on
  Cloudflare.
- Each member of the group has their own subdomain to showcase
  their individual photography, with the sdcard.photos landing page acting as a central hub for the collective.
- The landing page has a responsive design, ensuring that it looks great on all devices.
- _There's also a lil' easter egg hidden in the landing page, can you find it? ü§î_
